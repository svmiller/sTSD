\title{Summarize Unit Root Test Simulations}
\usage{
ur_summary(obj, pp_stat = "tau", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{the object to be summarized, of class 'spp_test'}

\item{pp_stat}{a statistic to be summarized: either "tau" or "rho". Applicable
only to Phillips-Perron tests generated by functions in this package.}

}
\value{
\code{ur_summary()} produces console output that offers a summary
assessment about the presence of a unit root based on your simulations.
}
\description{

included in this package.
}
\details{
This function makes ample use of the "attributes" element in the
list produced by the unit root simulations.
