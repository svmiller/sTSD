A data frame of quarterly indicators useful for modeling the demand for money
in the United States. Data go from the first quarter of 1960 to the third
quarter of 2024.

\details{
Data come by way of \pkg{fredr} call. Be mindful of changes in the
definition of the money supply, especially as they manifest in May 2020.
Subject domain expertise goes a long way here. The "M2" indicator is the "M1"
indicator with small-time deposits that are "close substitutes" for M1.
